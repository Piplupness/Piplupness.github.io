# Hi, I'm Brian
I'm a student at TJ who debates, swims, plays quizbowl, jams to music, researches political candidates, and tries to get some sleep. From what I've learned as PF co-captain this year and as an advocate for AP Euro, I've seen that we can do more to seek student voices and initiatives. As someone passionate about statistics and data, I want to leverage polling and surveys for us to gather information to drive and create meaningful change. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to [contact me](https://brianzhou.me/#contact)!

## My Vision
### Synopsis
I‚Äôm running to be the secretary that elevates student voices to find concerns and places where we can improve through anonymous polling and climate surveys with open-ended questions and responses. We all have ideas and visions for how TJ can be even better than it already is. We have opportunities to voice our ideas and suggestions, but these meetings are infrequent and under-advertised, and people may simply not be comfortable sharing criticism directly with administrators.

- **[üì£ Seeking Student Voices:](https://brianzhou.me/#hearing-authentic-student-voices)** Creating solutions that work to address student needs and concerns starts with hearing student voices. Find out how I will make our voice heard.
- **[üìñ Expanding Course Offerings:](https://brianzhou.me/#expanding-course-offerings)** Expanding Course Offerings: From Euro History and Art History to post-AP Bio and STEM classes, we all have passions we want to pursue in the classroom. I will make that happen.
- **[üìë Extracurricular Initiatives:](https://brianzhou.me/#extracurricular-initiatives)** We have ideas for events, initiatives, and projects. The SGA should provide logistical support for extracurricular initiatives and be their advocate to the school and related bodies.
- **[üëã A Safe Space:](https://brianzhou.me/#creating-a-safe-space)** Students should feel comfortable sharing their issues with support staff. Lean how I will build trust between students and staff.
- **[üíª Equitable Technology and Opprtunity Access:](https://brianzhou.me/#expanding-access-and-exposure-to-opportunities-and-technology)** We have so many unique opportunities at TJ, and we can do more to make students more knowledgeable about existing resources and opportunities. See how I aim to bring awareness of opportunities mainstream.
- **[üè´ Representing us to FCPS:]()**

### Hearing Authentic Student Voices:
Communication lies at the root of everything; good communication between the school and students means that resources can be utilized, voices can be heard, and we can build an inclusive and welcoming community.

I aim to create a student-led task force to poll students and hear their suggestions and comments on how the county can improve. Each high school is different and may have different wants and needs, so I aim to work with the SAC representatives and student governments from each high school to create open-ended questions related to each high school. Using this information, I want to provide the school board with a bi-annual report highlighting both the voices of our student body and of our unique high schools, and work to create constructive and meaningful solutions that can help tackle pain points for students, and help build a community by and for everyone.

### A Student Voice in the Budget:
The quarterly budget helps chart the course of FCPS, and shows where our priorities as a community lie. However, students can‚Äôt voice their input or participate in how our school board determines budget priorities. I seek to:

- Form a student led committee to create budget summaries for students to be well informed about budget priorities
- Create quarterly town halls for students to voice their thoughts on the budget and take ideas to the school board, inviting school board members as well to have meaningful discussions with both perspectives
- Implement student opinion polls to coincide with key times during school board input for the [budget development cycle](https://www.fcps.edu/about-fcps/budget/budget-development-calendar) in January and May

### Mental Health: 
Our mental health has never been more important than now. Nearly all of us have been impacted by the pandemic in some way, and our return to in-person instruction has presented new challenges for our mental health. 

While resources for mental health have been improving, many still do not use the resources available to them. This may be because they either are unaware or are uncomfortable accessing these resources. Additionally, mental health resources are drastically different across high schools - while some may have a wellness room, dedicated support staff, and student-led mental health clubs, other high schools may not.

I want to help students improve their mental well-being in ways they find comfortable. I would aim to 

- Push for more funding for mental health in the budget
  - Bring on full-time psychologists and social workers for each high school
  - Require the creation of open areas in all schools where students can talk with other students, meet with counselors, or talk to school psychologists, social workers, or Systems of Support Advisors (SOSA)‚Äôs
- Advocate for more discussion about our mental health
  - Encourage increased student interaction and connection with their counselors and support staff as they navigate high school
  - Work for county-level recognition of Our Minds Matter and encourage the development of OMM chapters

### Creating a Safe Space:
The education system supports students and their parents, and to better support students, we can communicate what information their parents will receive about them. Some examples come to mind, with student climate surveys, SEL screeners and wellness screenings, where students were unaware their parents received a letter with a rating attached to topics like belonging and decision-making, or that answering honestly might require counselors to call their parents.

I want to push to make it mandatory that students are made aware which situations would involve their parents. This is similar to letting patients know about a therapist‚Äôs mandatory reporting before therapy or your privacy rights on social media, as it helps make people conscious of what they respond with. I also want to work to allow parents to access the full context and results of these surveys; numerical scores can not paint a complete picture of their children‚Äôs thoughts and feelings, and rating their responses is a poor way of reflecting areas they can improve. Preparing both students and parents for these discussions allows them to have better discussions and productive results from the screeners.

### Expanding access and exposure to opportunities and technology: 
FCPS prepares graduates for post-secondary education and teaches us core life skills in leadership, collaboration, and communication. Resources and opportunities are core ways we can be more prepared as students to become global citizens. However, excellent resources and opportunities are under-advertised and under-utilized in the county, especially to those who may need them. How many students are aware that FCPS has a personal hotspot program for students or internet subsidies for students on free or reduced lunch? I want to advocate for the county as a whole to increase access and exposure to academic and extracurricular opportunities alongside education infrastructure throughout a student‚Äôs K-12 education 

To expand exposure, I want to create a student-run website available to everyone, listing upcoming opportunities, upcoming enrichment events, and FCPS technology and education programs. A website could help bring attention to opportunities for academic and personal enrichment and help compile information on opportunities such as dual enrollment available to students and summer programs or online courses, reducing the amount of research necessary on the student‚Äôs end. The aim of this would be to give students the resources, information, and exposure necessary for them to pursue what is interesting and enriching to them, and take advantage of FCPS programs. 

To expand access, I seek to analyze the FCPS budget. Specifically, I want to review the Capital Improvement Program (CIP) and the quarterly budget with the goal of reducing the strain on overcapacity schools and minimizing the impact of renovations on student education. In addition to that, I want to hear student feedback on current programs such as FCPSOn and MiFi, and even the new tutoring program, to recommend expansions or changes the school board could enact to help students who may not have access to stable internet at home necessary for success in the 21st century. Finally, I want to work to expand the online course catalog with offerings for all students to seek academic enrichment.
