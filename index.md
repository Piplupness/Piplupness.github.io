# Hi, I'm Brian
I'm a student at TJ who debates, swims, plays quizbowl, jams to music, researches political candidates, and tries to get some sleep. From what I've learned as PF co-captain this year and as an advocate for AP Euro, I've seen that we can do more to seek student voices and initiatives. As someone passionate about statistics and data, I want to leverage polling and surveys for us to gather information to drive and create meaningful change. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to [contact me](https://brianzhou.me/#contact)!

## Why Me
We all have passions. We all have visions. We see things that can be better, things that can be more transparent, or things that can be started at TJ. We want to build a place at TJ for us to explore our passions. We need a place where we can share our suggestions publicly or anonymously, and the support and backing to drive forward our initiatives and ideas. SGA is a bridge between students, the school, and FCPS, and SGA is our place to build change.

My passions have shaped my voice and perspective. My love for history and desire to learn more led me to advocate for the school to offer AP Euro. My passion for debate drove me to build a team that broke down barriers to entry. There are so many things at all levels we can do to improve our school and our community, and we all can create change for things that we are passionate about. 

My priorities are to hear your voices and passions, and to record and advocate for you every step of the way. From building a place to discover student life to hearing your input on TJ-wide and countywide policy, my goal is to uplift your voice.

## My Vision
### Synopsis
I‚Äôm running to be the secretary that elevates student voices to find concerns and places where we can improve. We all have ideas and visions for how TJ can be even better than it already is. Even though we have opportunities to voice our ideas and suggestions, we can do more to actively seek out voices. I want to acomplish this through open-ended anonymous polling and increased awareness to existing initiatives.

- **[üì£ Seeking Student Voices:](https://brianzhou.me/#hearing-authentic-student-voices)** Creating solutions that work to address student needs and concerns starts with hearing student voices. Find out how I will make our voice heard.
- **[üìñ Expanding Course Offerings:](https://brianzhou.me/#expanding-course-offerings)** From Euro History and Art History to post-AP Bio and STEM classes, we all have passions we want to pursue in the classroom. I will make that happen.
- **[üìë Extracurricular Initiatives:](https://brianzhou.me/#extracurricular-initiatives)** We have ideas for events, initiatives, and projects. The SGA should provide logistical support for extracurricular initiatives and be their advocate to the school and related bodies.
- **[üëã A Safe Space:](https://brianzhou.me/#creating-a-safe-space)** Students should feel comfortable sharing their issues with support staff. Learn how I will build trust between students and staff.
- **[üíª Student Life & Information Access:](https://brianzhou.me/#information-access)** We have so many unique opportunities at TJ, and we can do more to make students more knowledgeable about existing resources and opportunities. See how I aim to bring awareness of opportunities mainstream.
- **[üè´ Representing us to FCPS:](https://brianzhou.me/#representing-us-to-fcps)** The SGA also serves as the four members to FCPS's Student Advisory Council (SAC). I want to bring all our voices to the superintendent's table.

### Hearing Authentic Student Voices:
Communication lies at the root of everything; we need to communicate to share our thoughts and ideas from anything ranging from SEL to academics. Good communication between the school and students means that resources can be utilized, voices can be heard, and we can build an inclusive and welcoming community. I aim to create channels of communication between both students and SGA/the school, as well as between students and TJ-related organizations.

We all have amazing ideas that can make real change in the community. The SGA should support these ideas every step of the way. 

As SGA Secretary, I will create an Excomm task force to poll students and hear their suggestions and comments on where we can improve. I aim to include open-ended questions related to issues that students in specific classes or specific grad years may be facing so that we can reflect on the issues that are most important to everyone. I will make sure answering this survey is **anonymous** and all questions are **optional** so there is no burden on speaking up. Using this information, I want to expand visibility to SGA town halls and create meetings looking for input on time-sensitive items like course ideas to go over suggestions and hear community input to create transparent and meaningful solutions that can help tackle pain points for students, and help build a community by and for everyone.

We are also amazingly fortunate to have so many wonderful organizations in TJ and outside TJ whose goals are aligned with our success: the Finance office, Activities office, eighth period office, the Partnership Fund, PTSA, Academic Boosters, Athletic Boosters, and so many others. They graciously sponsor and support our clubs, activities, and events; they are our advocates. As SGA Secretary, I will create new ways for students to interact with these organizations through the SGA. My goal is to create a streamlined process where people with ideas for something amazing that can help our community can go through SGA to find support from these great organizations for funding and logistical support. 

**I will thus:**
 - Create a monthly or bi-monthly anonymous survey open to feedback on a range of topics with places for written feedback
 - Implement time-sensitive polls for gathering suggestions on upcoming events
 - Establish a centralized location summarizing the various administrative offices, support organizations at TJ, and TJ student government, alongside a guide for who to contact for what matters
 - Expand Open Forums (meetings with Dr. Bonitatibus) to other administrators and groups around TJ

### Expanding Course Offerings:
There is a worrying trend of courses slowly being removed over time, to not be offered again. This isn‚Äôt limited to one department or field. See some recent and late examples:
 - Japanese 1 and 2, which resulted in a TJ teacher being moved to Lake Braddock this year to teach. This is a common trend among language departments with the 1 and 2 language courses. If we don‚Äôt act now, it is likely all language departments will face existential staffing threats.
 - Probability Theory & Concrete Math, which was removed from the course catalog just this year
 - AP European History, which is on the course catalog but was unstaffed nearly a decade ago and has not been offered since.
 - AP Art History, similar to AP Euro in being on the course catalog but not offered in recent years
 - Cryptography, a math course offered [around and before 2016](https://www.tjtoday.org/17339/showcase/semester-long-math-courses-do-not-provide-students-with-enough-time-to-learn-the-curriculum/#modal-photo)

It‚Äôs understandable that budget cuts and tight schedules might result in courses not being staffed. But we can do more as a school and as students to show our interest in courses we want to take and create a system to have novel courses offered.

For the past two years, I‚Äôve tried to build interest for AP Euro specifically, by trying to make the staffing process more transparent to interested students and organizing surveys to see where student interest lies. I‚Äôve seen that that is a step in the right direction, but that we can only make courses offered when we have a unified framework for all classes, gathering more people and more backing.

A solution I want to implement as SGA secretary is a rotating schedule, where classes with limited or enough interest to field a class every two years would rotate with a similar class with a similar level of interest. Working with counselors and the school, we could potentially survey students to find courses with overlapping interest and build a schedule with rotating courses. This would allow for teachers to continue to stay at TJ and for people to have a chance to take any of the classes they are interested in. Take a rotating schedule between Euro and a Asian history course, or a schedule between two math/CS courses.

There are also so many courses we could try introducing. Take [Ethical Leadership, introduced in 2019](https://www.tjtoday.org/25453/features/taking-the-lead/#) or [Yoga in 2020](https://www.tjtoday.org/27869/news/yoga-class-offered-for-the-2020-2021-school-year/), recent classes introduced. We‚Äôre certainly a STEM school, but what makes TJ great is its excellence in every subject. We could have classes in finance or post-AP biology offerings; there are so many ideas for classes that we can find interest for if we have a place where we can gather interest.

To find course ideas with interest, I will implement specific course questions in the SGA surveys ([see above](https://brianzhou.me/#hearing-authentic-student-voiceshttps://brianzhou.me/#hearing-authentic-student-voices)) to find interesting ideas and release interest surveys and town halls in early December to gauge student interest and suggestions for suggested courses.

**I will thus:**
 - Implement a process for new courses to be suggested
   - Establish a start of the year town hall with a chance for students to share course ideas and pitch curriculums to department teachers to hear feedback and grow their ideas 
   - Arrange follow-up meetings with the administration to evaluate the suggestions‚Äô feasibility and create a course synopsis that can be used to gauge student interest
 - Work with counselors to create a time-sensitive course interest survey to gauge potential or committed interest for currently existing but unstaffed courses and student-proposed ideas for courses
 - Evaluate the feasibility of offering classes on a semifrequent basis to prevent people from losing interest in courses over time
 - Create top-down transparency with the master schedule and staffing decisions to find out why certain courses are no longer offered and seek ideas to develop solutions

### Extracurrricular Initiatives: 
We have ideas for club events, outreach initiatives, and projects. I want to establish a process for the SGA to provide logistical support for extracurricular initiatives and be their advocate to the school and stakeholders.

Specifically, I want to compile and release an information packet for prospective organizers detailing the process of starting initiatives at TJ for a range of activities, from STEM outreach to hosting tournaments. This packet would cover the fundraising process alongside relevant points of contact with stakeholders, and a way to contact the SGA for SGA assistance and logistical support.  

I aim to also expand on current initiatives such as extending the duration of activities fair and scope to all students across a longer time period.

**I will thus:**
 - Streamline the process for people who want to host tournaments, activities, or outreach initiatives at TJ
 - Find relevant information to create a TJ events packet
 - Expand the scope and duration of activities fair

[return](https://brianzhou.me/#my-vision)

### Creating a Safe Space:
The education system supports students and their parents, and to better support students, we can communicate what information their parents will receive about them. Some examples come to mind, with student climate surveys, SEL screeners, and wellness screenings, where students were unaware their parents received a letter with a rating attached to topics like belonging and decision-making, or that answering honestly might require counselors to call their parents.

I want to push to make it mandatory that students are made aware of which situations would involve their parents. This is similar to letting patients know about a therapist‚Äôs mandatory reporting before therapy or your privacy rights on social media, as it helps make people conscious of what they respond with. I also want to work to allow parents to access the full context and results of these surveys; numerical 1-5 scores can not paint a complete picture of their children‚Äôs thoughts and feelings, and rating their responses is a poor way of reflecting areas they can improve. Preparing both students and parents for these discussions allows them to have better discussions and productive results from the screeners.

**I will thus:**
 - Push for the expansion of climate surveys to more than numbers and for results to include the context of questions asked during the screener
 - Work with school administration to create channels where people are comfortable speaking up and establish transparency for when there is reporting
 - Actively seek student input on where we as a school can improve with our mental health resources

### Information Access: 
Excellent resources and opportunities are under-advertised and under-utilized in the county and at TJ. From student benefits to shining a spotlight on opportunities and providing a platform for advice on academics, extracurriculars, and spirit, there is more we can do to make information on opportunities and student life available.

There are a lot of questions we can compile answers to guide us throughout their time at TJ. Academics-wise: what is pass-fail? When should someone take summer TJ or summer FCPS? How do I navigate course selections? Community wise: what are the traditions like? What clubs related to my interests exist? There are great initiatives and people that already help tackle the information gap: from curriculum fair to BigSibs and TowardsTJ, and the amazing Ms. Connelly. I will take the next step, working to partner with clubs, initiatives, and administrators to build a repository of advice and information for TJ students of all levels. This would help list upcoming opportunities, upcoming enrichment events, student benefits, advice, and information on TJ‚Äôs unique programs and create a place to serve as the hub for info on student life. 

**I will thus:**
 - Establish a student life website to summarize opportunities and deadlines for students of all grade levels alongside advice and academic/extracurricular information
 - Create a calendar that can be filtered for academic deadlines, initiatives, or TJ opportunities that students and administrators can submit additions to via Ion authentication

[return](https://brianzhou.me/#my-vision)

### Representing us to FCPS: 
The SGA serves as the representatives to the Student Advisory Council (SAC) to the FCPS superintendent, meaning that your vote helps shape FCPS-wide policy. As a part of my effort to make our ideas and voices heard, I aim to elevate our advocacy into policy solutions through polling.

The purpose of the SAC is both to provide student policy input and to allow for each high school's ideas to be heard. My priority would be to create town halls and meetings at TJ so that the SGA can better shape FCPS-wide policy with the perspectives of all of TJ and not just the four representatives. I will work with the SGA to ensure that both our Student Representative to the School Board and superintendent hears our priorities, thoughts, and concerns.

**I will thus:**
 - Establish town halls centerd around the [budget development cycle](https://www.fcps.edu/about-fcps/budget/budget-development-calendar) to hear our input
 - Advertise and spread word of SGA meetings and surveys before SAC meetings to hear student input
 - Work with student leaders and county administrators to create periods where students can meet directly with county staff and ask questions or share their thoughts

## My Experience
I have been heavily involved in activities at TJ, serving as co-captain of Public Forum Debate and JV Liaison of Quizbowl. My experiences have given me a unique background in working with TJ teachers, administrators (Finance office, Eighth Period Office, and Activities Office), and stakeholders (Academic Boosters and the Partnership Fund) in launching new initiatives and logistics.

As co-captain of TJ‚Äôs Public Forum Debate team, I increased outreach and participation by doubling club size alongside making local tournaments free and substantially reducing national tournament costs. Alongside my co-captain and officers, I:
 - Coordinated and launched a mentorship initiative with more than 40 mentees and 10 mentors participating and additional outreach initiatives
 - Introduced new resources including a tournament calendar and eighth period calendar, which consolidated tournament registration information and lecture recordings and schedules for members to view. 
 - Personally created the club website to help make resources more available to club members.
 - Prioritized communication, highlighting achievements and upcoming events and tournaments on Facebook and through email 
 - Spearheaded a finance drive to raise funds that help us make competing more accessible for everyone, raising more than $4,000 with the help of bake sales, grants, and boosters support. 
 - Waived entry fees at local tournaments, various qualifiers & Metrofinals, and significantly reduced costs at national tournaments for our club members. 

My work with the debate team is a snapshot of my values and qualifications. I believe in making opportunities more accessible through financial support, educational support, and improving access to resources. I also seek to help make programs and education accessible to everyone, providing resources to each group to help them uplift their experiences. To accomplish this, I seek the input and opinions of my peers and coaches to make solutions that help all of us thrive.

I‚Äôm also the JV Liaison at TJ Quizbowl, where I represent the underclassmen to the club. I‚Äôve implemented more transparency in club communications, and created new initiatives:
 - Started weekly Quizbowl readings since July 2021 with around 10 members attending each week and over 90 total throughout the course of the year. This created a platform for us to meet friends and bring people from all interests together during COVID. The club grew to nearly 70 freshman members to 37 upperclassmen. 
 - Launched a housewrite initiative to encourage learning for underclassmen members
 - Ensured consistent club communication
 - Organized logistics from bake sale to phone-a-thon
 - Worked to advocate for members including tryout makeups and transparency
 - Created club website to highlight club activities

I‚Äôve also made sure that underclassmen voices are heard, advocating for more communication between leadership and JV members and creating lines of communication between people and our coach.

Quizbowl taught me a lot of things. There are so many ways we as a community and as individuals can do to launch initiatives that have meaningful effects in the community. It also taught me how to represent and advocate for ourselves to club leadership and our sponsor, and showed me that so many of my peers have ideas for what they want to change, we just need to listen and help them make it happen.

As SGA Secretary, I will seek to bridge divides and work with other students to help create our advocacy. My prior leadership will enable me to be a consensus-builder with other students and staff to create platforms and places where we can find our voice.
